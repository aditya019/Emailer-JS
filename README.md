# Emailer-JS
Using this app you can send email to anyone without using a browser.

A word of caution set the Access for less secure apps setting to Enable of your Email.

At the present moment it works great with Gmail, I have not yet tested it with other Email service providers.

This is simply a side project that I will integrate with my other project called profiler to send system generated emeails to users.
